(Note also that we didn't really need to take the `log()` of `Fare`, since random forests only care about order, and `log()` doesn't change the order -- we only did it to make our graphs earlier easier to read.)\n\nFor details about deriving and understanding feature importances, and the many other important diagnostic tools provided by random forests, take a look at [chapter 8](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/08_collab.ipynb) of [our book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So what can we take away from all this?\n\nI think the first thing I'd note from this is that, clearly, more complex models aren't always better. Our \"OneR\" model, consisting of a single binary split, was nearly as good as our more complex models. Perhaps in practice a simple model like this might be much easier to use, and could be worth considering. Our random forest wasn't an improvement on the single decision tree at all.\n\nSo we should always be careful to benchmark simple models, as see if they're good enough for our needs. In practice, you will often find that simple models will have trouble providing adequate accuracy for more complex tasks, such as recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, or multivariate time series. But there's no need to guess -- it's so easy to try a few different models, there's no reason not to give the simpler ones a go too!\n\nAnother thing I think we can take away is that random forests aren't actually that complicated at all. We were able to implement the key features of them in a notebook quite quickly. And they aren't sensitive to issues like normalization, interactions, or non-linear transformations, which make them extremely easy to work with, and hard to mess up!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you found this notebook useful, please remember to click the little up-arrow at the top to upvote it, since I like to know when people have found my work useful, and it helps others find it too.
