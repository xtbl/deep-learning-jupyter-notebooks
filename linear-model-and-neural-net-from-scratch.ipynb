In short, this acts as if there's a separate copy of the vector for every row of the matrix, so it divides each row of the matrix by the vector. In practice, it doesn't actually make any copies, and does the whole thing in a highly optimized way, taking full advantage of modern CPUs (or, indeed, GPUs, if we're using them). Broadcasting is one of the most important techniques for making your code concise, maintainable, and fast, so it's well worth studying and practicing.\n\nWe can now create predictions from our linear model, by adding up the rows of the product:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = (t_indep*coeffs).sum(axis=1)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.096685Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.097604Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.1028Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.097545Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.10218Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the first few:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preds[:10]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.160318Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.160794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.168117Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.160761Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:34:19.167355Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Of course, these predictions aren't going to be any use, since our coefficients are random -- they're just a starting point for our gradient descent process.\n\nTo do gradient descent, we need a loss function.

When you train the model in a moment, you'll see that the tiniest changes to these initialisations can cause our model to fail to train at all! This is a key reason that deep learning failed to make much progress in the early days -- it's very finicky to get a good starting point for our coefficients. Nowadays, we have ways to deal with that, which we'll learn about in other notebooks.\n\nOur deep learning `calc_preds` looks much the same as before, but now we loop through each layer, instead of listing them separately:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef calc_preds(coeffs, indeps):\n    layers,consts = coeffs\n    n = len(layers)\n    res = indeps\n    for i,l in enumerate(layers):\n        res = res@l + consts[i]\n        if i!=n-1: res = F.relu(res)\n    return torch.sigmoid(res)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:40:57.610142Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:40:57.610974Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:40:57.618154Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:40:57.610916Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:40:57.617329Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We also need a minor update to `update_coeffs` since we've got `layers` and `consts` separated now:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def update_coeffs(coeffs, lr):\n    layers,consts = coeffs\n    for layer in layers+consts:\n        layer.sub_(layer.grad * lr)\n        layer.grad.zero_()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:41:08.512494Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:41:08.513049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:41:08.519219Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:41:08.512999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:41:08.518093Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's train our model...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"coeffs = train_model(lr=4)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:41:23.632516Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:41:23.633004Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:41:23.666981Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:41:23.632953Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:41:23.666048Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"...and check its accuracy:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"acc(coeffs)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-30T22:41:25.490656Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-30T22:41:25.491182Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-30T22:41:25.497888Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-30T22:41:25.491146Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-30T22:41:25.49695Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Final thoughts","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's actually pretty cool that we've managed to create a real deep learning model from scratch and trained it to get over 80% accuracy on this task, all in the course of a single notebook!\n\nThe \"real\" deep learning models that are used in research and industry look very similar to this, and in fact if you look inside the source code of any deep learning model you'll recognise the basic steps are the same.\n\nThe biggest differences in practical models to what we have above are:\n\n- How initialisation and normalisation is done to ensure the model trains correctly every time\n- Regularization (to avoid over-fitting)\n- Modifying the neural net itself to take advantage of knowledge of the problem domain\n- Doing gradient descent steps on smaller batches, rather than the whole dataset.\n\nI'll be adding notebooks about all these later, and will add links here once they're ready.\n\nIf you found this notebook useful, please remember to click the little up-arrow at the top to upvote it, since I like to know when people have found my work useful, and it helps others find it too.
