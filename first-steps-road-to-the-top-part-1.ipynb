Creating an effective validation set\n> 2. Iterating rapidly to find changes which improve results on the validation set.\n\nHere I'm going to go further, showing the process I used to tackle the [Paddy Doctor](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification) competition, leading to four submissions in a row which all were (at the time of submission) in 1st place, each one more accurate than the last. You might be surprised to discover that the process of doing this was nearly entirely mechanistic and didn't involve any consideration of the actual data or evaluation details at all.\n\nThis notebook is the first in a series showing every step of the process. At the end of this notebook we'll have a basic submission; by the end of the series you'll see how I got to the top of the table!:\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/346999/174389920-60d67ead-0f36-41d0-9649-e23b08720c8a.png\" width=\"600\"/>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a special extra, I'm also opening up early a selection of \"walkthru\" videos that we've been preparing for the new upcoming fast.ai course.
